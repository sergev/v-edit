# Original Analysis

## Issues Found

### 1. **DeleteLines** - Off-by-one in delete_segments (line 159)
- **Problem**: Deleting lines 1-2 from 4 lines leaves 1 line instead of 2
- **Root cause**: In `delete_segments()`, the range calculation is incorrect. When deleting from line 1 to line 2, it's deleting 3 lines instead of 2.
- **Location**: workspace.cpp, `delete_segments()` method around line 479

### 2. **ToplineUpdateAfterEdit** - Boundary condition in update_topline_after_edit (line 274)
- **Problem**: After deleting 3 lines starting at line 60, topline becomes 55 instead of being clamped to 52
- **Root cause**: The `update_topline_after_edit()` doesn't account for the boundary correctly when deleting lines affects the view
- **Location**: workspace.cpp, `update_topline_after_edit()` method around line 677

### 3. **BuildFromText** - Temp file segment reading issue (line 360)
- **Problem**: `read_line_from_segment()` returns empty strings for lines stored in temp file
- **Root cause**: The segments created by `load_text()` use the tempfile fd, but `read_line_from_segment()` fails to read from them properly. The issue is that `set_current_segment()` isn't being called before reading, or the fdesc check logic is wrong.
- **Location**: workspace.cpp, `read_line_from_segment()` method around line 303

### 4. **SetCurrentSegmentNavigation** - Navigation beyond loaded content (line 389)
- **Problem**: Navigating to line 3 in a 6-line file returns 1 (beyond end) when it should return 0
- **Root cause**: `set_current_segment()` incorrectly determines the line is beyond the file when it's actually within bounds. The issue is in how it handles segments from temp files.
- **Location**: workspace.cpp, `set_current_segment()` method around line 124

### 5. **BreakSegmentVariations** - Breaking at lines beyond temp data (line 407)
- **Problem**: Breaking at line 3 in a 5-line temp file returns 1 instead of 0
- **Root cause**: Same as #4 - `breaksegm()` calls `set_current_segment()` which incorrectly thinks line 3 is beyond the end
- **Location**: workspace.cpp, `breaksegm()` method around line 353

### 6. **SegmentDeleteOperations** - Delete counting issue (line 453)
- **Problem**: Deleting a single line leaves 1 line instead of 2
- **Root cause**: Same as #1 - off-by-one error in delete range calculation
- **Location**: workspace.cpp, `delete_segments()` method

### 7. **ViewManagementComprehensive** - Scrolling clamping logic (line 470)
- **Problem**: When topline=85, scrolling down by 20 should clamp to 80 (max for 100 lines with 20 visible rows) but stays at 85
- **Root cause**: `scroll_vertical()` checks if already at bottom before scrolling, preventing the clamp. The condition `if (view.topline + max_rows >= total_lines)` returns early when topline is already beyond the valid range.
- **Location**: workspace.cpp, `scroll_vertical()` method around line 518

### 8. **ComplexEditWorkflow** - Insert operation line counting (line 499)
- **Problem**: After inserting 3 blank lines, expects 6 total lines but got 2
- **Root cause**: The `insert_segments()` method isn't properly handling the insertion. Looking at line 441, after inserting via `splice()`, the line count update might not be happening correctly, or the segments aren't being spliced at the right position.
- **Location**: workspace.cpp, `insert_segments()` method around line 436

## Fix Plan

Order of fixes (by dependency):

1. **Fix delete_segments range calculation** - The issue is likely in how we calculate which segments to delete using the from/to parameters
2. **Fix insert_segments positioning** - Ensure segments are inserted at the correct position and line counts updated
3. **Fix set_current_segment navigation** - Handle temp file segments correctly so navigation works within loaded content
4. **Fix read_line_from_segment for temp files** - Ensure reading from temp file segments works (may already work once #3 is fixed)
5. **Fix scroll_vertical clamping** - Remove the early return when already beyond bounds, allow clamping to occur
6. **Fix update_topline_after_edit boundary** - Ensure proper clamping after edits

## Root Causes

- **Delete/insert range calculations using inclusive/exclusive boundaries inconsistently**
- **set_current_segment incorrectly identifying temp file segments as "beyond end"**
- **scroll_vertical not clamping when already out of bounds**
