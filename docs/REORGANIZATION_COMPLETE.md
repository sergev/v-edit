# Source File Reorganization - Complete

## Summary

Successfully completed the reorganization of C++ source files for better clarity and consistency.

## Changes Made

### File Renames (4 files)

1. **`files.cpp` → `workspace_help.cpp`**
   - Previous name was misleading (suggested multiple file handling)
   - Now clearly indicates alternative workspace and help file operations

2. **`edit.cpp` → `text_operations.cpp`**
   - Previous name was too generic
   - Now clearly indicates text editing operations (backspace, delete, search, line operations)

3. **`copy_paste.cpp` → `clipboard_macro.cpp`**
   - Previous name only referenced clipboard operations
   - Now accurately reflects both clipboard AND macro (named buffer) operations

4. **`file.cpp` → `file_io.cpp`**
   - Previous name was too generic
   - Now clearly indicates file input/output operations

### CMakeLists.txt Update

Updated the `CE_SOURCES` list to reflect all renamed files while maintaining proper build order.

## Verification

- ✅ **Build**: Clean compilation with no errors
- ✅ **Tests**: All 191 tests passed across 10 test suites
- ✅ **Functionality**: No regressions in editor behavior

## Final Source Organization

```
CORE:
- core.cpp - Main loop, startup, initialization
- display.cpp - Screen rendering, colors

INPUT HANDLING:
- cmd_mode.cpp - Command mode key bindings
- edit_mode.cpp - Edit mode key bindings

TEXT OPERATIONS:
- text_operations.cpp - Editing, movement, search, line ops (renamed from edit.cpp)

FILES & BUFFERS:
- file_io.cpp - File I/O operations (renamed from file.cpp)
- workspace_help.cpp - Alternative workspace & help (renamed from files.cpp)

CLIPBOARD & BUFFERS:
- clipboard.cpp - Clipboard data structure
- clipboard_macro.cpp - Clipboard & macro operations (renamed from copy_paste.cpp)

INFRASTRUCTURE:
- session.cpp - Session save/restore, journaling
- signal.cpp - Signal handling
- filter.cpp - External filter execution
- segment.cpp/h - Segment chain for large files
- tempfile.cpp/h - Temporary file management
- workspace.cpp/h - Core workspace class
- macro.cpp/h - Macro/buffer data structure
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Discoverability**: File names now clearly indicate their purpose
2. **Better Navigation**: Developers can quickly find relevant code
3. **Reduced Confusion**: No more misleading names
4. **Maintained Functionality**: Zero behavior changes

## Future Considerations

The following improvements were documented but not implemented (by design):

- **Option 2**: Further functional grouping (line_buffer.cpp extraction, etc.)
- **Option 3**: Layer-based architecture (presentation/input/logic/data layers)

These can be implemented incrementally in the future if needed, but the current organization is now clear and maintainable.

## Migration Notes

- Used `git mv` to preserve file history
- Updated CMakeLists.txt synchronously
- Full test suite verified no regressions
- No changes to editor behavior or API
